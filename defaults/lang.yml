# This file can be used to modify any text in-game.  Color codes can be used throughout, the list
# of codes are at the bottom of this file.  Anywhere you see a word inside <% %> it means it is
# a placeholder for some information from the game.  These can NOT be translated.  If you do try
# to translate these, Epidemic will not know where to put the internal value.  The internal values
# should be language agnostic, so no translation is needed.  (Frequently these internal values
# come from the ailment and remedy configuration files which can also be updated.
# If a value is missing from this file, when it is called in-game, it will write the default value
# into this file.
# Please be sure to back this file up if you have translated it.  Updates may replace this file
