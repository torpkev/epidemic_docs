## Default Ailments

Ailments in Epidemic are illnesses and injuries the player can get.  They can be caused by being around a sick person, just bad look, or caused by a variety of non-infectious means such as falls, explosions etc.

You can see more information about Ailments here: [Ailment Information](https://torpkev.github.io/epidemic_docs/ailments)

Epidemic creates default ailment files for the plugin to work right out the box, they are store in the Epidemic/ailments folder.  However, it is strongly recommended that you either modify or completely recreate custom ailment files that best suit your server.  You can see more information on creating your own ailments here: [Creating new ailments](https://torpkev.github.io/epidemic_docs/newailments)
