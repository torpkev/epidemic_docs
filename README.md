Epidemic allows you to add illness and injury to your server, making survival that much more difficult.

Whether you want to have your players risk a cut or broken leg from being attacked or from a fall, to food poisoning when they eat, to a light fever all the way up to a full blown plague that causes blindness and confusion, Epidemic has you covered.

Epidemic is highly configurable, allowing you to create your own illnesses and injuries, letting you decide how likely a player is to suffer and how badly. You can even decide if you want the illness to be contagious or if a broken leg can develop into an infection! Potion effects such as slowness, blindness and confusion can all be added to an illness, making the player work to stay alive. Real consequences to a fall beyond losing a half-heart of health means real survival.

Epidemic also includes a custom thirst bar that must be continually refilled, and a temperature system that looks at a players core temperature, their surrounds, biomes and more.

With Epidemic on your server, your players can even hide their symptoms and infect other players, adding a level of biological warfare (full bio-warfare including splash potions, arrows and vaccines is coming in 1.7.0!).

Each injury or illness can have its own cure added, so if your player suffers a broken leg, no problem - they can craft a splint, or travel into town and buy one from a store.

Players in op or with epidemic.invincible cannot gain injury/illness.
