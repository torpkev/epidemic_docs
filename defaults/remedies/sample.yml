# Sample
# The sample remedy is intended to show how you would lay out your own remedies.
# It includes a very simple set of values, some of which are commented out in order
# to show two different ways of doing things (for example, potion_color can be by
# name or by rgb - in the sample, it is using RGB, but you could comment those 3
# lines out and instead uncomment the name line.
# It also includes a commented out furnace recipe as you can't have both a crafting
# recipe and a furnace recipe active (if both are uncommented, the crafting recipe
# is used.  A BARRIER is used in the crafting recipe of the sample to avoid having
# it appear accidentally for the player if not removed
# REMEMBER: IT IS UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE THE RECIPE YOU'RE USING IS NOT ALREADY IN USE!
