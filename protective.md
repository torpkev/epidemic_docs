## Protective Equipment

### Hazmat Suit

The Hazmat Suit is the ultimate protection from contagious diseases.  While wearing it, the player cannot be infected by being around other players who are sick, randomly getting sick, or being impacted by infected splash potions.  

Hazmat Suits are REQUIRED for working with an Incubation Chamber, which is used to culture infected blood into samples that can be used for bio-warfare and vaccines (coming soon)

However, Hazmat Suits are very fragile, and any damage at all could lead to the suit being destroyed outright. 

Hazmat Suits are created in 3 stages:

 **Faceplate**

The faceplate is 3 layers of glass pane, surrounded by a mix of copper and iron ingots

**Germ-proof Material**

The Hazmat rated material blocks any pesky germs coming in, and is created using 6 leather, 4 slime balls, and 9 yellow dye (to make it a pretty color)

**Combining the faceplate and material**

To create the Hazmat suit, you'll need to combine a faceplate, with 8 hazmat material

**Usage**

To use the Hazmat suit, simply take the helmet you're given in your right hand (don't worry, the rest of the suit is folded up inside the helmet) and right click anywhere in the world, the entire suit will be put on.  To take it back off, simply click the helmet and it'll be taken off and returned to your inventory

### Gas Mask

The gas mask works in a similar manner to the Hazmat Suit, in that it keeps out contagious diseases, however, as it only covers your face, the level of protection is much lower, and while you'll be at less risk of getting sick, you still might.

The Gas Mask is a single stage build that takes 5 leather, 3 glass panes, 2 iron ingots, and 3 charcoal to filter the air
