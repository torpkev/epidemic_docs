## **Ailments**

Ailments are any infectious/non-infectious illness or injury that can be applied to a player.  They can be set to be contagious or affect only the player who has it.  They can also lead to secondary ailments which afflict the player
after a set amount of time if the original ailment isn't cured in time.  You can even set the ailment to be hidden from the player for a set amount of time, during which, they could be infecting any number of other players.

Each ailment has a number of possible configuration options to allow you to create extremely customized illnesses and injuries that best fit your server.

**Ailment Configuration**

Ailment files are .yml files stored in the ailments folder.  They should be named as the internal_name (details below) .yml -  For example: broken_leg.yml

Ailment file version, this MUST match the currently required version and should not ever be modified by hand.  If the ailment configuration ever needs to update, it will replace this value automatically.

    v: 1.1

Internal key name should be a unique value and should not include any spaces or most special characters (underscores are acceptable.)  

    internal_name: "broken_leg"

Display name is how the ailment will be referred to in-game.  It can include color codes or any special character that is allowed in-game.

    display_name: "Broken Leg"

The infectious flag indicates if this ailment can be passed along to other players.  If so, being close to someone who has this ailment will increase your chance of catching the ailment.  This should only be set if the ailment
is infectious.  For example, you can't catch a broken leg.

    infectious: false

Infectious chance is the number between 0-10000 for a player getting this ailment via infectious means (not caused by a fall or injury, but instead being around other sick players, or just being unlucky enough to get it).
Every 60 seconds (by default - this number can be modified in the config), each infectious ailment will generate a random number between 0-10000, if that number is <= your infectious chance, you will get that ailment.  Your
infectious chance can be modified by other things, for example, a person near you with the ailment can boost your chance of getting it, but having an immunity could lower your chance. 

    infectious_chance: 0

Non-Infectious chance is the number between 0-10000 for a player getting this ailment via non-infectious means, for example, a fall or burn.  Non-infectious ailments need to be caused by something (covered later in the configuration), and the chance of getting it works the same as infectious.  If the random number generated <= your non-infectious chance, you will get the ailment.  Immunity and being around other contagious players etc. will not impact your non-infectious chance, however, if the damage chance modifier (covered later in the configuration) is set, your chance could increase based on the damage you have received.

    non_infectious_chance: 250

Contagious chance boost is the amount to add on to your infectious chance if you are near a player who has the ailment.  For example, if you have an infectious chance of 200, and an infectious chance boost of 50, with the boost, if the random number was <= 200, you would get the ailment.  With the boost, if the number <= 250, you would get the ailment.  The boost is added to infectious_chance and used to calculate your chance of getting the ailment.

    contagious_chance_boost: 0

Maximum immunity amount is the maximum immunity you can gain to infectious ailments.  Your immunity will increase based on the number of times you have recovered from an illness up the maximum set here.  The immunity is used to lower your chance of getting an ailment.  For example, if you have a maximum immunity of 100, and your current immunity is 80, and your infectious chance is 200 (with 0 boost), your new infectious chance would be 200 - 80 = 120 so you would only get the ailment if the random number generated was <= 120 instead of <= 200. 

    max_immunity: 0

Immunity modifier is the amount to add to your immunity for this ailment each time you recover from the ailment.  If your immunity modifier was 10 and your current immunity was 70, with a max_immunity of 80, the next time you were healed from this ailment, it would reach the maximum of 80.  If you got the ailment and was healed again, it would remain 80.

    immunity_modifier: 0

Report before symptoms indicates if the ailment should show up when using the /health command if symptoms have not yet been applied.  Setting this to false would show no ailment in /health if symptoms have not been applied, if they have been applied, it would show the ailment.

    report_before_symptoms: true

If true, the warn on afflicted flag will send the afflicted_text to the player when the player gets the ailment.  This can be used in conjunction with report_before_symptoms = false to hide the ailment from the player until they start to show symptoms.  This can be used to have the player spread the ailment to other people without their knowledge.

    warn_on_afflicted: true

Afflicted text is the message to send to the player when they get the ailment (if warn_on_afflicted = true).  It
can contain color codes and any special characters that are allowed in-game.  If the message is left blank, no
message will be sent to the player. 

    afflicted_text: "Your leg breaks with a sickening crack"

Symptom text is the message to send to the player when symptoms first start.  This is especially useful if you have
a long period between affliction and symptoms.  It can contain color codes and any special character allowed in-game.
If this is left blank, no message will be sent.

    symptom_text: "The pain is starting to make you nauseous"

Infected Other text is the message the player receives if they cause another player to become sick through being near them.  If you are hiding affliction from the player, you may want to leave this blank, however, if you don't
mind the player knowing that they have the affliction (purposefully spreading illness is valid), then you can include the message for the player here.  It can contain color codes and any special character allowed in-game.
If this is left blank, no message will be sent.

    infected_other_text: ""

Healed text is the message sent to the player when they are cured of an ailment.  It can contain color codes and any special character allowed in-game. If this is left blank, no message will be sent.

    healed_text: "Your leg is feeling much better!"

Natural cure text is the message sent to the player if they are cured of an ailment over time.  It can contain color codes and any special character allowed in-game.  If this is left blank, no message will be sent.
**NOTE: Currently, there is no way to be cured naturally, but it is planned for 1.7.0**

    natural_cure_text: "Your leg has improved and you can put weight on it again"

Time to symptoms is the number of seconds between a player getting an ailment, and them actually starting to show symptoms for it.  For non-infectious ailments such as a broken leg, you might want symptoms to be immediate, in which case, set it to 0.  For infectious ailments, you may want the player to spread the ailment before they start to show symptoms, in which case you can specify the number of seconds to wait.

    time_to_symptoms: 0

Is Fatal is a true/false flag for if the damage applied to the player can be fatal.  If false, the damage for the player will stop if it would take to 0 health.  However, if they have a potion effect applied that also causes damage, the player may still die even if the ailment itself is not fatal.  When false, the lowest health a player can go to is half a heart.

    is_fatal: false

Damage is how much damage to apply to the player each time symptoms are applied.  By default, each 1 damage is half of a hearts worth of damage, so if you wanted them to drop 2 hearts of damage, you'd set damage to 4. Damage will not be applied if is_fatal = true and the damage would take them to 0 health.

    damage: 1

Secondary ailments are a pointer to another ailment that should be applied if the player does not cure the original ailment within the amount of time specified.  Secondary ailments replace the 'secondary_infection' from previous versions, and allows much more control over the secondary ailment.  For example, you could have Gangrene as a secondary ailment for a broken leg, and Sepsis as a secondary ailment for a wound.  Each of those could have their own remedies, and could apply vastly different effects.  Chaining secondary ailments is NOT recommended and NOT supported (chaining would be setting a secondary ailment on a secondary ailment).
Once a player has gotten a secondary ailment, they will not get that secondary ailment again if they cure it, until the original ailment has been cured (or the player dies) and they get the original ailment a second time.  For
example: If a player gets a broken leg, then gets gangrene, they can cure the gangrene but not the broken leg, in that case, the broken leg will not lead to gangrene a second time.  However, if they cure the broken leg and then
break their leg again, they can get gangrene as a secondary ailment.
