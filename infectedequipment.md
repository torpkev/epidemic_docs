## Infected Equipment

### Infected Arrows

Infected arrows are a great way to let some one know you really really want them to be sick.  To create an infected arrow, you'll need 4 arrows, and an infected sample.  This will give you 4 infected arrows which can be fired as normal.

Be careful with them, if you fire them and miss, when picking them up, the infected sample will be gone.

Infected Arrows are a great way to spread a disease, but do require that you are accurate.  Near misses do not count, but you do get 4 shots for each sample.

### Infected Splash Potion

Infected Splash Potions are a less surgical method of spreading disease - you may accidentally infect yourself or others, and the relatively high cost of 1 potion per sample means more work required to build up a stockpile.

However, any player within 3 blocks of the splash potion will be infected

To create an infected splash potion, you'll need 1 infected sample, and 1 water splash potion
